Adds statics for:
* Kourou Airport
    * Main runway 07/25 (2500m)
    * Long runway 12/30 (4000m)
* Kourou Sounding Rockets launch complex
    * Administrative Support buildings and communication mast
    * Kourou SR-01 - bare level 1 launch pad
    * Kourou SR-02 - concrete pad for heavier sounding rockets (e.g. V-2)
* KLC-01 Launch complex
    * Situated at location of Diamant launch complex at Kourou
    * Raised ramp to small launch pad
    * Suitable for slightly larger rockets

* Requires:
    * Kerbal Konstructs
    * Kerbinside Core
    * Kerbinside Remastered (delete the folder ExampleBases inside GameData/KerbinsideRemastered/Statics)

* Compatibility
    * Adds definitions for runways to NavUtilities if installed.

## Known Issues

* Some sort of collider issue with the Kourou Airport Runway is causing landed craft to jitter and bounce. I recommend only using Kourou Long Runway at the moment
