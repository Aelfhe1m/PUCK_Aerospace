# KOUROU configs for Kerbal Konstructs

* Requires:
  * Kerbal Konstructs
  * Kerbinside Core
  * Kerbinside Remastered (delete the folder ExampleBases inside GameData/KerbinsideRemastered/Statics)

* Compatibility
  * Adds definitions for runways to NavUtilities if installed.

## Known Issues

* Some sort of collider issue with the Kourou Airport Runway is causing landed craft to jitter and bounce. I recommend only using Kourou Long Runway at the moment
