# PUCK Aerospace
Patches, custom configs, flags and other content to support my KSP RP-1 playthrough.

PUCK Aerospace is a ficticious alternate-history rocket development and launching company operating out of Kourou in South America. The company is founded in 1951 by (ficticious) Scottish entrepreneur Peadar Ã™isdean Cameron Kincaid (aka PUCK). They begin development based on government grants from France and Nova Alba (fictional).
